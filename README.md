# Things I have done
* Bl Touch. Ender 6 has a Molex Picoblade 1.25mm pitch connector. - https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Molex-PicoBlade-1-25-micro-connector-2-3-4-5-6-Pin-leads-100mm-28-AWG-wire-PCB/232695637343?hash=item362dbda55f:g:vHoAAOSwWmNapoY1
* USB connector is broken out with an extension cable


# To Do
* Z axis leadscrew  replace with finer pitch
* better filament roller support that doesn't rub
* extension for the filment sensor to align it with the feeder
* a clip to hold the bowden so it doesnt dnag on the blue connector
* jog wheel
* better PSU

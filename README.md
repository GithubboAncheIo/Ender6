# Cura 4.8 config
* Copy all files relating to ender from their slicer to Cura.
* I was using flatpak so added them to ~/.cura folders
* Info from here - https://forum.creality.com/topic/1172/creality-ender-6-cura-slicer-profile/3

# To Do
* Z axis leadscrew  replace with finer pitch
* better filament roller support that doesn't rub
* extension for the filment sensor to align it with the feeder
* a clip to hold the bowden so it doesnt dnag on the blue connector
* jog wheel
* better PSU

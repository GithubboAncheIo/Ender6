# Creality Ender 6

Unboxing
Missing side panel
Knife blade cut on front door
Chip in touchscreen


Build
Really easy. No missing screws etc, tools supplied worked well.
The step about plugging in the wires wasn't too clear, so had to do that when the panel was on.

Getting the screws in on the filament sensor and the extruder was not easy
corner brackets was a bit rubiks cube
Getting the hotend cabling trunk into the clips was not only hard but drew actual blood
Use the online instructions! The paper ones should not exist.
1:30 build time


Initial thoughts.
It's quite big. Especially compared to the effective print size
Well made, very solid
CoreXY was calibrated well, when measured it was < 0.1mm out.
Well thought out design
It isn't quiet. The hotend fan is noisy. really noisy. Everything else is good
The supplied firmware is clunky and a bit annoying to use.
 - will flash stock Marlin
it is fast and can maintain decent prints at high speed.

Print test
Bed levelling was ok, but was unaligned quickly.
Had to really screw the z-sensor in tight to stop it moving while printing
Heated bed is underwhelming and was reasonly fast. 25-60deg in about 4 minutes
Hotend is the usual affair, functional but not special.
I tested the supplied image on the SD card "gou". It's clearly not for this machine as it is slow to print. It did complete in a reasonable amount of time at 450% speed.
At very high speed there is a tiny amount of bed wobble.
Bed adhesion was ok, but my previous hot swappable IKEA glass panels were way stickier, if less stable under heating.

Quality
Print quality is good. Actually really quite impressive given the price.
The strong mechanism really lets you crank the speed. 

PLA and ABS work fine, no retration problems.
Feeding the bowden was really easy

Bed

Good strong rough finished glass. Does not flex in the heat. Sandpapers the nozzle when you don't level the bed properly!

Adhesion
Rocky at first. The supplied PLA is junk, so get better filament ready.
Adhesion with a big brim was fine. Thin models needed the bed to be cranked to more than 50

Temperature (all measurements 20mm from edge)
The measured vs displayed is quite close. measured 47 at set 60
Heating is even except for the extreme edges of the bed. The measured was 32 degrees on the left edge of the bed 
The hottest I got it was 72. That took 10 minutes


Software
Their slicer is functional but has many cura features stripped. Weird. I will be switching over to stock Cura once I have ported the cfgs


Thing I have noticed while using the machine
Default beep is LOUD. WHY!
I have the machine set reasonably low on a bench. using the touchscreen at an angle from above can lead to you pressing the wrong thing. I miss the jog wheel.
You need a JST to JST cable for bltouch. There are some vids on youtube of hacking some cables together. I don't have one to do that to... yet.
The UI goes from Chinese script to english when the change screen. Yeah.

Gripes
The z stage can start to slowly slide down once a print has finished. The z-stepper switches off, and a heavy print and the arch nemesis gravity duke it out. It is weird, annoying and slightly concerning watching yur large print hit the deck.
A sub gripe being I use that space below as a cupboard/filament store.
Did I mention the fan on the hotend was loud?
I question the utility of the door and sides, especially as it has no top. It won't stop inquisitive fingers getting mangled in the mechanism from the top. Odd choice.

Future mods on my list
Jog wheel
install the bltouch
Better trunk clips, also with a clip to keep th bowden from sagging around
Z stage bed cable management, or something to stop the wires dangling
Expose the USB connector
Change the ungodly loud hotend fan for something that whispers an angelic chorus

Summary
For the Â£400 I paid, it is a decent machine. The software is poo, and I will write a guide of how I got marlin on there and cura profile working.
If you have the room, it is a decent machine. It lets you print fast, and still has good enough quality.
